# ispAnnoyance
I was tired of not getting the internet speeds I paid for, so I wrote this script to do a speed test and tweet at my ISP when I wasn't getting what I should be.
This script is intended to be ran on a cron timer and uses the Twitter API. I've included a requirements.txt file that should allow you to install everything you need. (```pip install -r requirements.txt```)
